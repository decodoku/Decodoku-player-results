Then the same for the nearby 2 and 8. The same for the two 2-8 pairs in the top right corner. Then the 5-5 pair. Then the 1-9 and 6-4. Then we just have things near the ?s, which give us 5 for top-left and 3 for bottom-right.","First I'd remove the 7-1-2 near the top-left. Then the 8-1-1. That whole weird thing going from bottom-left to top right adds up to a multiple of 10, so I'd get rid of all that too. This leaves the top-left as 0 and the bottom-right as 8.","I start by pruning leaves. First the 1-9 on the mid-right. Then the 2-8. Then the 5-5 and 2-8. This leaves 3-3-4 isolated in a corner, so I'd get rid of that too. On the left side I'd prune away the 5-5 and then 2-8 and then 3-7 and then 4-6. I'd follow this with the 2-3-5 at the bottom and then the 7-3. Next I'd get rid of the 2-8 near the top-left. Finally I'd clean up all the isolated bits left to find that top-left and bottom-right are both 0.",The four 5s in the bottom-left would be removed. Then the 3 near the top-right (giving top-left=5). Then I'd assume that the rest all clears up to give bottom-right=0.,"First the 3-7 on the left side. Then the 5-5 on the right. Then the 3-7 near the top-right (but not the 3 at the top). Then the 3-2-5 near the top-left. Then the 8-2 at the bottom and 5-5 on the right. Then the 6-1-1-1-1. The 8 gives bottom-right=0 and the rest cancels, so top-left=0","From bottom-left, 9-1 then 6-4 then 7-3. From that point, 4-6 then 7-3 and 5-5 then 8-2, 4-6 ,9-1, 6-4, 5-5, 8-2, 1-9.

Most of them equal 10, except six groups. Four of those are standing alone. I will come back to those. Next, the top left needs to equal 10, thus the top-left equals 5. Also, the bottom-right got me for a  moment. But I came to conclude it was 3 because 9+8=17 and we need it to be 20, so add 3 to 17. Finally the 4 individual pieces are similar. Why? because the two corners equal 10 and the 2 in the middle, well, just cut the puzzle in half and put one ontop the other, you'll get 10.",This one is a tad more difficult. But everything still equals 10/20. The top left equals nothing because it needs to be 10. The bottom right equals 8 because the bottom right is over 10 so it needs to equal 20.,"All the numbers equal 10 by being grouped respectively with ones next to them. Since I can't explain that any better, let's get to the 2 ?'s. They'"""" both be blank. This is because everything already equals 10. However, if that's not the case the 2 #'s can be 9 and 1. Since they don't have a respective number to go with, they could be combined to make 10","The top left is 5 because since the numbers add up to 15, and it's over 10, it needs to equal 20. The bottom right is blank [idk why, it is just a feeling I have]",The top left is blank because there's nothing that goes with it and the bottom right is 2 because the four 1's help the six get to 10,"Top-left is 1 because the 5,2,and the other 2 add up to 9 and we need one more. The bottom right is blank because there's nothing for it to go with","Top left is 7 because 3 needs to equal 10, and 7 helps it do that. The bottom right is 5 because the 8 is actually paired with the 2 one square from it. This makes the 5,
2, and 3 equal 10. 2 of the 5 can be paired to make 10 and the spare 5 needs something to make 10, thus the bottom right is 5",---,---
