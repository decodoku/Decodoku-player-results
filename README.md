# Decodoku Player Results

[Decodoku](http://decodoku.com/) is a citizen science project, that allows players to contribute to the development of quantum computers.

The project is made up of three games, *Decodoku*, *Decodoku:Colors* and *Decodoku:Puzzles*. Players are encouraged to examine their methods for solving the puzzles in these games, to discuss them at the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/decodoku/). They can then submit descriptions of the methods to this repository, either directly, on the subreddit or by email.

Not included in this repository is a genetic algorithm to solve Decodoku Puzzles, available [here](https://github.com/sneakyweasel/genetic-quantum-correction) and [here](https://github.com/decodoku/genetic-quantum-correction).
